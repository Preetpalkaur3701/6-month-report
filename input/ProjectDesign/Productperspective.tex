\section{Product Perspective}
   
This product is supposed to be part of an open source, under the LGPLv2+ license. It is a CAD software for 3D modeling application, made primarily to design real-
life objects. Rebar Addon is the idea given by the user's only to fullfill their needs and It had been in demand even before it consentment. It will extent this already powerfull system by allowing the user to create reinforcement through an easy and intuitive way. It will also provide a way to modify the set of parameters using FreeCAD Python console.
   
The following are the main features that are included in Rebar Addon for FreeCAD

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cross platform support:} Offers operating support for most of the known and commercial operating systems in form of binaries and also it can be compiled on other platforms.
   
    \item \textbf{Allows to create rebars using GUI:} The system allows the user to reinforce rebars by simply filling in input fields.
   
    \item \textbf{Backward Compatibility:} FreeCAD should be backward compatibility even after new features are implemented.
   
    \item \textbf{Rebar parameters:} The created rebars will have their own view and data properties. User can edit the parameters of the group of rebars from the view \& data properties itself.
   
   
    \item \textbf{Parametrization:} These rebars will be fully parametric. Hence the parameters of the rebars will automatically adjust themselves if the changes are made to their parent structure.
    
    \item \textbf{Different operations:} The rebars will also have the functionality to cut, copy, clone, move and rotate.
   
\end{enumerate}
