\section{Objective of Project}
One of the primary benefit of thepoet.me is to create a personal identity page for poets or writers. It's a great place to pull together your online profiles into one place so people know where to find you across different social networks.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item The goals of this project.
   \item Developing a best social platform for poets or writers.
   \item Providing a link to poets that present them.
   \item Offer them a one page website where they can add their book.
   \item Linking their social accounts in one place.
\end{enumerate}


%The major Objectives of this project are:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Syntax support for generation of customization form:
%    The customization form generated on Thingiverse is based on a certain syntax for both describing the elements in the form and providing a range of their values. In order to make this work in OpenSCAD as well, the same style of description and parameterization can be incorporated into OpenSCAD. Hence the user will be able to generate the customization form from within OpenSCAD by adding a few simple lines in the .scad file.
%  
%    Customization of the model from the form:
%    Once the form is ready, it must be able to customize the model as desired by the user. The changes made in the form should directly correspond to changes in the model itself.
%    Enhancing the UI for the customization form:
%    The customization form is there to make the whole customization thing easy. And that implies that the form itself should also be easy to use. And this can be achieved by having a good and simple look to the whole thing.
