\section{The Existing System}
At present, the rebar functionality in FreeCAD is very limited and creating a reinforcement system is quite tedious. The current approach is followed by creating a sketch for the rebar profile and defining the required set of constraints. This becomes very time-consuming task when user has building model with several structural objects. We can only creates planar rebars by using current rebar tool. 

{\bf {Limitations of previous system }}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item The AST of Rebar object was not strong.
	
	\item It creates only planar rebars.
	
	\item Circular dependencies issue with Arch structural object.
	
	\item Lack of User interface.
	
	\item No default rebar shapes present.
	
	\item Complex workflow.
	
	\item Rebar object not calculates its rebar length.

    \item Reinforcing rebars in real building model is very time-consuming task.
	
\end{itemize}
