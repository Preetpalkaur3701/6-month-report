\section{User Requirement Analysis}
User Requirements Analysis for a software system is a complete description of the requirements of the User. It includes functional Requirements
and Non-functional Requirements. Non-functional requirements are
requirements which impose constraints on the design or implementation.

 
{\bf Users of the System:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Poet or writer:} A poet is a person who writes poetry. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry.
        \item \textbf{Author:} A writer of a book, article, or document.        
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  {\bf Specific Requirements}: This phase covers the whole requirements for the system. After
    understanding the system we need the input data to the system then we watch the output
    and determine whether the output from the system is according to our requirements or not.
    So what we have to input and then what well get as output is given in this phase. This phase
    also describe the software and non-function requirements of the system.

    \item {\bf Input Requirements of the System}:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Social Login/Signup:} This means there should be an option so that a user can Login or Register as new user using his/her social accounts. (Facebook, Gmail)
     \item \textbf{Signup:} This means there should be an option so that a user can register.
     \item \textbf{Login:} This means there should be an option so that a user can login after successful registration.
     \item \textbf{Password Reset:} This means there should be an option so that a user can change his/her password.
     \item \textbf{Lost Password:} This means there should be an option so that a user can set a new password in case he/she forgot the old one.
     \item \textbf{Edit Profile:} This means there should be an option so that a user can edit his/her profile anytime after successful login.
     \item \textbf{User profile Link:} This means there should be an option so that a user can copy his profile link.
     \item \textbf{Social networking links:} This means there should be an option so that a user can add his/her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram links. 
     \item \textbf{Book Cover:} This means there should be an option so that a user can add his/her bookâ€™s cover and details.

     \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item E-mail should be sent using time of registration or password reset.
   \item User web page should be shown after clicking on his/her profile link.
   \item Site should be fully responsive.
\end{enumerate}
